Walkthrough (due 04/20/16):

-Explain how you would add your own hello world program so that you are able to execute it from the xv6 shell.
Modify the Makefile's USER_PROGS and UPROGS to allow the execution of program with a keyword (for example, just the command "hello").
Then take a template of an already complete program, make a copy of it, and change the copy so that it outputs "hello world". Also, edit the EXTRA part of the Makefile to include this new file.

-Track the operation of the wait system call using the debugger. Explain what happens when the process has no children when it has a child process.


-Explain how the current scheduler works, including interaction with the timer.
