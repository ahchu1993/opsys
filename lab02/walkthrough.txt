The walkthrough tentatively consists of the following questions (may be subject ot modifications until May 11). 
Where an outline of an implementation is requested, you have to list all the major items clearly:

-Outline the implementation of the semaphore acquire function using pseudocode. Also present the pseudocode for problem 3 of the synchronization problems.

-Reach chapter 2 in the xv6 book. Briefly explain the operation of kvmalloc() and mappages() and Figure 2-2.

-Outline your plan to implement Part 2.1
